M-BUILD Intel 1.2.5 RELEASE NOTES
=================================
Release date: July 26, 2013

This release did the following changes for icl:
1. Added "/Qstd" to specific language standard, apply c99 to C source file and c++0x to C++ source file, and it's synchronized with icc now.
2. Removed "/debug" which implied by "/Zi".
3. Removed "/Ob2" which specifies the level of inline function expansion. It's implied by "/O2" or "/O3".


M-BUILD Intel 1.2.4 RELEASE NOTES
=================================
Release date: July 12, 2013

This release added IPP library path for OS X, and removed options "-fast", "-fno-alias" and "-fno-ansi" ("-fno-ansi" is an illegal option) which broken hilbert tests on linux_amd64_icc with model_armv6_release. Option "-fno-alias" determines whether aliasing should be assumed in the program, it is recommended only as an experiment, possibly to see whether a useful restrict keyword has been missed. It would mean that the compiler could ignore unproven aliasing hazards. Setting "-fno-alias" imply adding keyword "restrict" for every function.
This release also added "-ansi-alias -Wstrict-aliasing" for icc and /Qunroll /Qansi-alias" for icl for better performance.


M-BUILD Intel 1.2.3 RELEASE NOTES
=================================
Release date: May 10, 2013

This release prevents complaints (remark #2415: variable "DLB_L10" of static storage duration was declared but never referenced; remark #981: operands are evaluated in unspecified order; remark #1572: floating-point equality and inequality comparisons are unreliable) in icc builds and tweak up icc build optimisations.
