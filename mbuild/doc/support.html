<h1>M-Build System Requirements</h1>

<p>M-Build will run with python 2.6.x or 2.7.x. You may also use pypy (targetting the same language versions) which will typically give a large performance improvement.</p>

<p>Python version 3.x is not supported.</p>

<p>All operating systems are supported, however users of cygwin should be careful with respect to newlines as it and applications within it often behave inconsistently here. M-Build should run, but the generated files from it may not be what you want.</p>
